## Star of Bethlehem (3-2 BC)

**Scripture:** Matthew 2:1-12

> "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him... the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."

### The Sequence of Events

The Star of Bethlehem was not a single event but a series of astronomical phenomena spanning 3-2 BC that would have been highly significant to Babylonian Magi (professional astronomers/astrologers).

#### 1. Jupiter-Regulus Triple Conjunction (3-2 BC)

Jupiter (the "King Planet") conjuncted with Regulus (the "King Star" in Leo, the Lion of Judah) three times due to retrograde motion:

| Event | Date | Location | Significance |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| **Conjunction #1** | Sept 14, 3 BC | Babylon | First meeting - Magi begin watching |
| **Conjunction #2** | Feb 17, 2 BC | Babylon | Jupiter retrogrades back to Regulus |
| **Conjunction #3** | May 8, 2 BC | Babylon | Triple conjunction complete |

**Symbolism:** The King Planet "crowning" the King Star in the constellation of the Lion (tribe of Judah) three times - an unprecedented royal birth announcement.

#### 2. Jupiter-Venus Super-Conjunction (June 17, 2 BC)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Date** | June 17, 2 BC (June 15, 1 BC in astronomical dating) |
| **Separation** | 0.011° (0.6 arcminutes) |
| **Appearance** | Single brilliant "star" |
| **Combined magnitude** | ~-6.5 (brighter than any star) |
| **Constellation** | Leo |
| **Location observed** | Babylon/Persia |

**Stellarium Verification:**
- Jupiter: Leo
- Venus: Leo
- Angular separation: ~1.5° (close conjunction)

This is likely "the star" the Magi saw that prompted their journey - Jupiter and Venus merged into a single dazzling point of light in Leo.

#### 3. Jupiter Stationary Over Bethlehem (Dec 25, 2 BC)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Date** | December 25, 2 BC |
| **Time** | ~5:00 AM |
| **Location** | Viewed from Jerusalem |
| **Direction** | South toward Bethlehem |
| **Event** | Jupiter at stationary point in retrograde |

**Significance:** Planets appear to "stop" when changing from prograde to retrograde motion (or vice versa). When the Magi traveled from Jerusalem to Bethlehem (~6 miles south), Jupiter would have appeared directly ahead, stationary in the sky - fulfilling "the star... stood over where the young child was."

### Summary Timeline

```
Sept 3 BC    - Jupiter-Regulus #1 (Magi notice)
Feb 2 BC     - Jupiter-Regulus #2 (Confirmation)
May 2 BC     - Jupiter-Regulus #3 (Decision to travel?)
June 2 BC    - Jupiter-Venus conjunction (The brilliant "star")
Dec 2 BC     - Jupiter stationary over Bethlehem (Arrival)
```

## Crucifixion Darkness & Blood Moon (33 AD)

**Scripture:** Luke 23:44-45, Acts 2:20

> "And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened..."

> "The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come." - Peter at Pentecost, quoting Joel 2:31

### Daytime Darkness

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Date** | April 3, 33 AD |
| **Time** | ~12:00 noon (6th hour) |
| **Location** | Jerusalem |
| **Event** | Solar darkening |

**Note:** A normal solar eclipse is not possible during Passover (full moon). The darkness described may have been:
- Miraculous/supernatural
- A dust storm (khamsin)
- Atmospheric phenomenon

### Evening Blood Moon - The Critical Evidence

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Date** | April 3, 33 AD (evening) |
| **Time** | Moonrise (~6:20 PM) |
| **Location** | Jerusalem |
| **Event** | Partial lunar eclipse |
| **Appearance** | Moon rose already in eclipse - blood red |

**Key Historical Facts:**

1. **Only Passover eclipse during Pilate's governorship** - Of all the Passovers from AD 26-36 (Pilate's tenure), only ONE had a lunar eclipse visible from Jerusalem: April 3, 33 AD.

2. **Moon rose in eclipse** - The eclipse was already in progress when the moon rose over Jerusalem. Observers would have seen a blood-red moon rising on the eastern horizon as the crucified Christ hung on the cross.

3. **Peter's Pentecost reference** - Seven weeks later, Peter quoted Joel 2:31 ("moon turned to blood") as having been fulfilled (Acts 2:16-20). He may have been referencing the literal blood moon that accompanied the crucifixion.

4. **Bookended by blood** - Christ's atoning death was literally bookended by blood: His shed blood on the cross, and the blood-red moon rising that evening.

### 2000-Year Parallel

This creates a striking parallel with 2033:

| AD 33 | AD 2033 |
|-------|---------|
| Blood moon on Passover | Blood moon on Passover |
| April 3, 33 AD | April 14, 2033 |
| Visible from Jerusalem | Visible from Jerusalem |
| Crucifixion day | 2000th anniversary |

**Stellarium Configuration:** Shows positions of Sun and Moon on this date for visualization.

## Joshua's Long Day (1207 BC)

**Scripture:** Joshua 10:12-13

> "Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed..."

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Date** | October 30, 1207 BC (proleptic Gregorian) |
| **Time** | ~2:00 PM |
| **Location** | Gibeon, Israel |
| **Event** | Annular solar eclipse |

### Humphreys Theory

Cambridge physicist Colin Humphreys proposed that the Hebrew word "dmm" (דמם) means "to cease/be silent" rather than "stand still." This reinterpretation suggests Joshua witnessed the Sun "ceasing" its normal appearance - an eclipse.

**Stellarium Verification:** An annular solar eclipse occurred on this date, visible from Canaan.

## Revelation 12 Sign (1827 & 2017 AD)

**Scripture:** Revelation 12:1-2

> "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: And she being with child cried, travailing in birth..."

### Criteria (Strict Interpretation)

| Element | Astronomical Requirement |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Woman | Virgo constellation |
| Clothed with sun | Sun in Virgo |
| Crown of 12 stars | Planets in Leo (adding to Leo's 9 stars) |
| With child | Jupiter in Virgo ("womb" region) |

**Required Configuration:**
- Sun: Virgo (IAU)
- Jupiter: Virgo (IAU)
- Mercury: Leo (IAU)
- Venus: Leo (IAU)
- Mars: Leo (IAU)

### Verified Occurrences

After systematic Stellarium verification across 2000+ years:

| Date | Sun | Jupiter | Mercury | Venus | Mars | Status |
|------|-----|---------|---------|-------|------|--------|
| **1827 AD Sep 16** | Virgo | Virgo | Leo | Leo | Leo | **VERIFIED** |
| **2017 AD Sep 16-23** | Virgo | Virgo | Leo | Leo | Leo | **VERIFIED** |

**Gap:** ~1,797 years from 30 AD to 1827 AD with NO verified full matches.

### Rejected Candidates

| Date | Reason for Rejection |
|------|---------------------|
| 1069 AD | Jupiter in Libra (not Virgo) - Skyfield boundary error |
| 108 AD | Jupiter in Libra |
| 298 AD | Jupiter in Libra |
| 1056 AD | Jupiter in Libra |

**Note:** Skyfield's constellation boundaries differ from IAU/Stellarium. All candidates must be verified with Stellarium's `iauConstellation` field.

### 2017 Occurrence - Historical Context

**September 16, 2017:**
- Full Revelation 12 configuration in the sky
- "Mother of All Rallies" (MOAR) held on National Mall, Washington DC
- Pro-Trump rally to support "American culture"

**September 23, 2017:**
- Configuration still in place
- Widely publicized as "Revelation 12 sign"
- NFL kneeling controversy dominated news
- Healthcare bill collapse (McCain vote)
- Hurricane Maria devastation of Puerto Rico

### Symbolic Parallels: America and Virgo

America's national symbols feature prominent female imagery:

| American Symbol | Virgo/Rev 12 Parallel |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Statue of Liberty | Robed woman |
| Crown with 7 rays | Crown of stars |
| Torch (light) | Clothed with sun |
| Columbia | Female personification |
| "Lady Liberty" | "Woman" of Revelation 12 |

**The "Mother of All Rallies" Coincidence:**
- Rally named after a "mother" figure
- Held while celestial "mother" (Virgo) displayed the Revelation 12 configuration
- Parallel to Star of Bethlehem as a "birth" sign

### Comparison: Birth Signs

| Event | Date | Configuration | "Birth" |
|-------|------|---------------|---------|
| Star of Bethlehem | 3-2 BC | Jupiter + Venus in Leo | Birth of Christ |
| Revelation 12 Sign | 2017 AD | Jupiter in Virgo, planets in Leo | "Birth" of movement? |

Both feature:
- Jupiter (King planet)
- Leo (Lion / royalty)
- Birth narrative
- Virgo region involvement

## Blood Moon Prophecy (2014-2015)

**Scripture:** Joel 2:31, Acts 2:20

> "The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come."

### Blood Moon Tetrad (2014-2015)

Four consecutive total lunar eclipses falling on Jewish feast days:

| Date | Feast | Visibility |
|------|-------|------------|
| April 15, 2014 | Passover | Americas, Pacific |
| October 8, 2014 | Sukkot | Pacific, Americas |
| April 4, 2015 | Passover | Pacific, Americas |
| September 28, 2015 | Sukkot | Americas, Europe, Africa |

**Stellarium Configuration:** April 15, 2014 eclipse viewable from Jerusalem.

## Technical Notes

### Verification Methodology

1. Set location using `set_biblical_location()`
2. Set date using `set_time_gregorian()`
3. Query each object with `get_object_info()`
4. Check `iauConstellation` field (IAU boundaries)

### Known Issues

- **Skyfield vs Stellarium:** Skyfield's constellation boundaries approximate IAU but can differ by several degrees near boundaries
- **Always verify with Stellarium** for final confirmation
- **Proleptic Gregorian dates:** BC dates use astronomical year numbering (0 = 1 BC, -1 = 2 BC)

### Julian Date Reference

| Event | Julian Date |
|-------|-------------|
| Star of Bethlehem (Jupiter-Venus) | 1720858.25 |
| Crucifixion | 1733204.5 |
| Joshua's Long Day | 1280869.083 |
| Revelation 12 (2017) | 2458019.5 |
